# Diabetes Health Project

**Status:** Phase 2 - Data Preprocessing Completed.
Applied data cleaning, outlier detection, and Spearman correlation for feature selection based on referenced research.


## Project Information
* **Project Description:** This project focuses on applying advanced data mining techniques to a comprehensive diabetes health dataset to uncover patterns and factors influencing the disease. The core objective is to formalize a predictive and analytical framework by executing two primary data mining tasks: **classification and clustering**. 
* **Project Motivation:** The motivation for this study stems from the critical need for early diabetes detection to prevent severe, long-term health complications such as cardiovascular disease and renal failure. By identifying key risk factors—ranging from BMI and blood pressure to lifestyle habits—this project aims to enhance early intervention strategies.
